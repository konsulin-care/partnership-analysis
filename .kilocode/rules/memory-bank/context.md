# Current Work Focus

The project is in the initialization phase. Core architecture and requirements are defined, templates and configuration files are in place, but the main Python source code under `src/python/` has not yet been implemented. The focus is on building the modular components for web research, data extraction, financial calculations, schema normalization, and PDF generation via Carbone SDK.

# Recent Changes

- Established project structure with Conda environment, configuration templates, and memory bank documentation
- Created JSON schema and Carbone template examples for partnership analysis reports
- Defined comprehensive architecture for reproducible, LLM-minimized report generation

# Next Steps

- Implement the core Python modules as outlined in `architecture.md`
- Set up the orchestration layer for workflow coordination
- Develop unit tests for each module
- Create integration tests for end-to-end report generation
- Add example input configuration files for testing
- Implement error handling and logging infrastructure
